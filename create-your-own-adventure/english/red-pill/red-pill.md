An wrinkled old man with a funny hat appears and hands you a red pill and a glass of chocolate milk. 

You take the pill then drink the milk and within seconds you become extremely hungry but only for tacos.

The only problem is, there is no taco-place in the proximity of 1000 kilometers and you are a terrible cook.
